# 🏋️‍♀️ Personal Fitness Tracker
A simple and interactive **Streamlit** web application that predicts a user’s fitness level based on health and lifestyle inputs. The model uses supervised machine learning algorithms to classify fitness as **High** or **Low**.

## 🔍 Models Used:
This project implements and supports the following ML algorithms:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
 > 📌 The current deployment uses a `Random Forest` model trained on simulated data for demonstration purposes.
